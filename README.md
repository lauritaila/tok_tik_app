# ðŸ“± TokTik - TikTok Clone App

Welcome to TokTik, a Flutter-based application that replicates the core video feed functionality of TikTok. This app is built using Clean Architecture principles to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. The app allows users to scroll through a vertical feed of short videos, similar to TikTok's interface.

## Features

- **Vertical Video Feed**: Seamlessly scroll through a feed of short videos.
- **Clean Architecture**: The app is structured using Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers.
- **Customizable Theme**: Easily customize the app's theme using the config/theme folder.
- **Local Video Playback**: Videos are stored locally in the assets/videos folder and played using the video_player package.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the provider package for efficient state management.

- Rename the videos as 1.mp4, 2.mp4, ..., 8.mp4.
- Place them in the assets/videos folder.

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
5. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run

## Project Structure (Clean Architecture Inspired)

The app follows a basic structure inspired by Clean Architecture, separating concerns into layers:

```
tok_tik_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart               # Entry point of the application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Configuration and utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ theme/              # App theme (colors, fonts, etc.)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers/            # Helper functions and utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain/                 # Domain layer (business logic)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/        # Data sources interfaces
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/       # Repository interfaces
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ entities/           # Business entities (core data structures)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/         # Infrastructure layer (data sources and models)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ datasources/        # Implementation of data sources
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # Data models (e.g., video models)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/       # Implementation of repositories
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/           # Presentation layer (UI and state management)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens/            # App screens (pages)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/            # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ providers/          # State management (using Provider)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/                 # Shared resources (e.g., local data)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                     # Static assets (e.g., videos)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ videos/                 # Folder containing video files
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                       # Unit and widget tests
â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml                # Project dependencies
```

### How the Layers Work Together:

1. **`domain/entities/`**: Define the core business entities.
2. **`domain/repositories/`**:Define repository interfaces for data access.
3. **`infrastructure/models/`**: Map API responses (or other data sources) to the domain entities.
4. **`infrastructure/datasources/`**: Map data to domain entities (e.g., VideoModel).
5. **`infrastructure/repositories/`**: Implement repository interfaces.
6. **`presentation/providers/`**: Use `Provider` to manage app state.
7. **`presentation/screens/`**: Display the UI and interact with the state managed by the providers.
8. **`config/`**: Provides global configurations and utilities used across the app.
